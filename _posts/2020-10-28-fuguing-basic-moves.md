In [Sacred Harp singing,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Harp) a
fuguing tune isn't like a classical fugue, with voices that echo each
other melodically according to strict rules. Any song
counts as a fuguing tune if, at some point, the voices drop out and come back
in one or two at a time.

Usually by the end of a fuguing tune, everyone is in
rhythmic unison again.

There are endless fine points of artistry in writing a good fuguing tune. But
before you can even start trying to apply your creativity, there's an annoying
technical problem you have to solve: *how do you get the voices synced back up
again?*

<hr>

This problem is, weirdly, mostly about words.

In a traditional hymn, everyone sings the same words. Everyone sings in
rhythmic unison, nobody skips any words, and if anyone repeats a word or a
phrase then everyone else does too.

But if you did all that in a fuguing tune — that is, if you *started at
different times* and then did that, singing the same words at the same pace,
not skipping, and not repeating more or less than anyone else — you'd never
come back into sync...

Something would have to give.

So to get the voices synced up you have to break some of the rules of
pacing in traditional hymn singing. 

People have been commenting for centuries on our breaking of these and
other rules — sometimes talking as if old Sacred Harp composers didn't
know any better, and sometimes crediting them with [writing consciously
experimental music.](http://www.neelybrucemusic.com/CORK-talk-2011.pdf) 
But in either case, rule-breakers is what we are, and here is what that
most often amounts to:

- Some voices might slow down and noodle around, or stop entirely, while others keep going.
- Some voices might repeat a lyric while others don't.

Sometimes fuguing tunes do other illegal things, but these are by far the
most common, and they're all you really need to get a fuguing tune to work.

## Staggered and gathered

But writing a fuguing tune isn't just about breaking the rules. It's about
knowing what will happen when you do.

If you take a line in a basic hymn meter, and sing it as a sequence of
quarter notes, it takes up two measures. 

```lilypond
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##f
pitch = a 
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
la4 | La' La La8[ So] Fa4 | So So So8[ Fa] 
}
\addlyrics { In all my fears, _ in all my straits, _ }
```

(Well, it starts and ends at the upbeat. But basically two measures. The
tendency to start on the upbeat in fuguing tunes is so strong that it
makes more sense to count as if measures start on beat 4 rather than 
beat 1.)

The entrances in a fuguing tune are usually a measure apart. So in the
simplest case, with the most basic rhythm, the first voice finishes
when the second is only halfway done.

```lilypond
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##f
pitch = a 
\new ChoirStaff <<
\new Staff = "tenor" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
r4 | r2. la4 | La' La La8[ So] Fa4 | So So So8[ Fa] 
}
\addlyrics { In all my fears, _ in all my straits, _ }
}
\new Staff = "bass" {
\fasola c, { 
\key c \major
\clef bass
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
La4 | la la la8[ so] fa4 | La La La 
}
\addlyrics { In "all my fears, in all my straits," _}
}
>>
```

In colored blocks, they look like this:

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="464" height="65" viewBox="0 0 464 65" stroke="#000" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lightblue" fill-rule="evenodd">
    <path d="M4.5 34.5h100v25H4.5zm50-30h100v25h-100z"/>
</svg>

Let's make up a term and say those voices are _staggered_. If two voices
aren't staggered anymore, let's say they're _gathered_.

## Staggered by one

So how do you gather voices that are staggered by one measure?

One way is stretch out the voice that's ahead. Instead of straight
quarter notes, give it longer ones.  Alternating quarter and dotted half notes is common.

```lilypond
\paper{
ragged-right = ##t
}
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##f
pitch = a 
\new ChoirStaff <<
\new Staff = "tenor" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
r4 | r2. la4 | La' La La8[ So] Fa4 | So So So8[ Fa] 
mi4 | Fa Fa Fa8[ mi] la[ Fa] | mi4 mi mi8[ la]
}
\addlyrics { In all my fears, _ in all my straits, _
My soul on his _ sal-- _ va -- tion waits. _ }
}
\new Staff = "bass" {
\fasola c, { 
\key c \major
\clef bass
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
La4 | la la la8[ so] fa4 | La La La 
fa8[ La] | So4 So So La8[ So] | \override NoteHead #'color = #red Fa2. So4 | La2.
}
\addlyrics { In all my fears, _ in all my straits,
My _ soul on his sal-- _ va -- tion waits. }
}
>>
```

In block terms: instead of this...

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="464" height="65" viewBox="0 0 464 65" stroke="#000" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" fill="#fff" fill-rule="evenodd">
    <path d="M4.5 34.5h100v25H4.5zm50-30h100v25h-100z" class="lightblue"/>
    <path d="M109.5 34.5h100v25h-100zm50-30h100v25h-100z" class="lightred"/>
</svg>

...our buddy Daniel Read decided to do this.

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="464" height="65" viewBox="0 0 464 65" stroke="#000" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" fill="#fff" fill-rule="evenodd">
    <path d="M4.5 34.5h100v25H4.5zm50-30h100v25h-100z" class="lightblue"/>
    <path d="M109.5 34.5h150v25h-150zm50-30h100v25h-100z" class="lightred"/>
</svg>

Once he's done that, the two parts are gathered and ready to move
forward in sync again.

```lilypond
\paper{
ragged-right = ##t
}
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##f
pitch = a 
\new ChoirStaff <<
\new Staff = "tenor" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
r4 | r2. la4 | La' La La8[ So] Fa4 | So So So8[ Fa] 
mi4 |\break Fa Fa Fa8[ mi] la[ Fa] | mi4 mi mi8[ la] 
\override NoteHead #'color = #red 
so4 | la8[ mi]
}
\addlyrics { In all my fears, _ in all my straits, _
My soul on his _ sal-- _ va -- tion waits, _
My soul }
}
\new Staff = "bass" {
\fasola c, { 
\key c \major
\clef bass
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
La4 | la la la8[ so] fa4 | La La La 
fa8[ La] | So4 So So La8[ So] | Fa2. So4 | La2.
\override NoteHead #'color = #red
La4 | la4
}
\addlyrics { In all my fears, _ in all my straits,
My _ soul on his sal-- _ va -- tion waits,
My soul }
}
>>
```

Another thing you can do with voices that are staggered by one...

```lilypond
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##t
pitch = bf 
\new ChoirStaff <<
\new Staff = "tenor" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
r4 | r2. Fa4 | La La La Fa | mi So So
}
\addlyrics {The year of ju -- bi -- lee is come }
}
\new Staff = "bass" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
so4 | Fa Fa Fa so | la la la
}
\addlyrics {The year of ju -- bi -- lee is come}
}
>>
```

...is to make them swap places by letting the one that's behind repeat a line.

```lilypond
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##t
pitch = bf 
\new ChoirStaff <<
\new Staff = "tenor" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
r4 | r2. Fa4 | La La La Fa | mi So So
}
\addlyrics {The year of ju -- bi -- lee is come }
}
\new Staff = "bass" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
so4 | Fa Fa Fa so | la la la 
\override NoteHead #'color = #red
Fa | So So So La | Fa Fa Fa
}
\addlyrics {
The year of ju -- bi -- lee is come
The year of ju -- bi -- lee is come

}
}
>>
```

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="464" height="65" viewBox="0 0 464 65" stroke="#000" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lightblue" fill-rule="evenodd">
    <path d="M4.5 34.5h100v25H4.5zm50-30h100v25h-100zm55 30h100v25h-100z"/>
</svg>

That doesn't gather them immediately, but it sets up some new options.
Now you could slow down the higher line instead of the lower one.


```lilypond
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##t
pitch = bf 
\new ChoirStaff <<
\new Staff = "tenor" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
r4 | r2. Fa4 | La La La Fa | mi So So
\override NoteHead #'color = #red
Fa | La2. La4 | Fa2. Fa4 | mi2. mi4 | Fa2.
}
\addlyrics {The year of ju -- bi -- lee is come,
Re -- turn, ye ran -- somed sin -- ners, home. }
}
\new Staff = "bass" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
so4 | Fa Fa Fa so | la la la 
Fa | So So So La | Fa Fa Fa \bar""\break
so | la la la Fa | So2. mi4 | Fa2.
}
\addlyrics {
The year of ju -- bi -- lee is come
The year of ju -- bi -- lee is come
Re -- turn, ye ran -- somed sin -- ners, home. }
}
>>
```

## Staggered by two

When voices are staggered by two measures, there's an extra thing you can
do. Repeating a line in the one that's behind will now gather them together
instead of swapping them.

```lilypond
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##f
pitch = a
\new ChoirStaff <<
\new Staff = "treble" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
r4 | r1 | r2. mi4 | La La La fa | La La La
}
\addlyrics { Where na -- ture all in ru -- in lies, }
}
\new Staff = "tenor" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
la4 | La' La La fa8[ La] | So4 So So So | Fa Fa Fa So8[ Fa] | mi4 mi mi
}
\addlyrics { 
Where na -- ture all in _ ru -- in lies, 
Where na -- ture all in _ ru -- in lies, }
}
>>
```

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="464" height="65" viewBox="0 0 464 65" stroke="#000" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lightblue" fill-rule="evenodd">
    <path d="M4.5 34.5h95v25h-95zm100 0h95v25h-95zm0-30h95v25h-95z"/>
</svg>

Stretching still works too. You just have to stretch _harder._ 

```lilypond
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##t
pitch = f
\new ChoirStaff <<
\new Staff = "treble" {
\fasola c' { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
r4 | r1 | r2. La4 | so so so so | la mi Fa2~ | Fa2.
}
\addlyrics { ’Tis grace di -- vine, all -- conq’r -- ing, free, }
}
\new Staff = "tenor" {
\fasola c { 
\key c \major
\partial 4
\sacredHarpHeads
\clef bass
so4 | Fa Fa Fa Fa | so2. so4 | Fa1( | So2 so, | Fa2.)
}
\addlyrics { ’Tis grace di -- vine, all -- conq’r -- ing, free, }
}

## The fun part

In a very funny way, now you know everything you need to know about gathering
voices. It's all just stretching and repeating (though sometimes with some
fancy twists I haven't talked about: you can stretch by a fraction of a
measure, or repeat only part of a phrase).

In another sense, this is completely missing the point. Lining bricks up isn't
composing. It isn't even the _rhythmic_ part of composing. If I've got these two measures...

```lilypond
\paper{
ragged-right = ##t
}
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##f
pitch = c 
\relative c'' { 
\key c \major
\sacredHarpHeads
\partial 4 
c4 | c4 c c e | g e c
}
\addlyrics { "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ }
```

...and need to stretch them out to four, 
I could decorate them in any of these ways or
dozens of others. 

```lilypond
\paper{
ragged-right = ##t
}
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##f
pitch = c 
\relative c'' { 
\key c \major
\sacredHarpHeads
\partial 4 
c4 | c4 c c e | g e c2~ | c1~ | c2.
}
\addlyrics { "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ }
```

```lilypond
\paper{
ragged-right = ##t
}
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##f
pitch = c 
\relative c'' { 
\key c \major
\sacredHarpHeads
\partial 4 
c4 | c2. c4 | c( d e) f | g( f e ) d | c2.
}
\addlyrics { A -- ma -- zing grace, how sweet the sound }
```

```lilypond
\paper{
ragged-right = ##t
}
\include "fasola.ily"
isMajor = ##f
pitch = c 
\relative c'' { 
\key c \major
\sacredHarpHeads
\partial 4 
c4 | c4. c8 c4 r | r2. e4 | g4. e8 c4 r | r2.
}
\addlyrics { A -- ma -- zing grace! How sweet the sound! }
```

```lilypond
\relative c'' { 
\key c \major
\sacredHarpHeads
\partial 4 
c4 | c8[( d] e[ f] g[ a]) g4 | g4 g4 g4.( e8 | c4) c c4( b | a2.)
}
\addlyrics { A -- ma -- zing grace, how sweet the sound }
```

If I realize I need to stretch a part, it's more like a door opening: I could
do this a million ways — which would be most fun to sing? 

Or I can meet the muse halfway: Inspiration just struck for a treble-alto duet
on these words! Now, to flesh that inspiration out, I might need to do some 
math: How can I arrange my blocks to make it happen? What combination
of moves will get them there together at the right time?

Or I can think about tradeoffs: "Either I stretch this one or I repeat and then
stretch that one — which would be cooler?"

Or I can recognize when I'm in a dead end: "No wonder this isn't working. I
can't stretch this part any further and still have the rhythm I want. I'd
better back up and rethink this."

And this is just two voices. In future posts I'm hoping to talk about:

- How to keep your head straight when you're using these moves on four
  voices instead of two.
- Traditional and untraditional ways to use them.
- Using them to make cool musical things happen.
- Using them to make cool _social_ things happen.
