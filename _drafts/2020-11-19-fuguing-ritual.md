[In the last post, I talked about how get the voices in a fuguing tune in and
out of sync]({% post_url 2020-10-28-fuguing-basic-moves %}). This post is a
very eccentric take on why it matters.

Suppose that a Sacred Harp convention is a ritual. 

It isn't necessarily a *religious* ritual, though of course for many of us these songs are deeply religious. For others, it's a *secular* ritual — think of Scouting traditions, Burning Man, Mardi Gras, Homecoming, New Years, or Pride parades. 

Like in many rituals, we gather on a special day. Like in many rituals, we mark off a space (in the square) and a span of time (between the opening and closing prayer) where special rules apply. Like in many rituals, we *build up energy* in that space, by singing and praying and stomping and moving. 

Most rituals *do something* with that energy once they build it up. As far as I can tell, what we do is aim it at each other.

If you don't always sing alto, think about your favorite altos. 

Probably you've had this experience. You're singing along, head down in your book, the whole class is loud and tuned-up and full of energy and every note sounds good, and then from across the square you hear A NOTE. A GLORIOUS NOTE. A NOTE THAT SOUNDS FAR BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHERS. 

You look up, and you lock eyes with the singer on the alto bench who is singing that note. And in that moment, that singer — whether friend or stranger — is your favorite person in the world. Without them, the world would be an immeasurably worse place. You can't wait to sing with them again so you can hear that GLORIOUS NOTE one more time. You want them to have a long and happy life so you can hear them sing that note year after year. 

What you've done in that moment is, you've taken the ritual energy that the class called up together, you've fixed your attention on someone, and you've poured the energy into *caring about* that someone just a bit more than before.

There are all sorts of other moments you can have. Maybe you catch someone's eye because your two parts are harmonizing in a nice way, or clashing in one. Maybe because you have matching rhythms. Maybe because you're coming in together after a silence. Maybe because they told a joke about this verse five years ago and it still cracks you up. Maybe just because you happen to look up and think "THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART" at the same time. But those are all chances to bring your attention together, and to appreciate each other, and to pour the energy into *caring about* each other.

If that's all true — and who knows? it might be — then the songs we sing are ritual tools that create those moments. Some build up energy. Some ground it. Some spread it around. And all of them give us opportunities to pay attention to each other, and to pour that energy into enjoying each other. 

Fugues play a special part in all this, because they create moments when we can pay attention to each other in unique ways.

- The leader moves around the square, looking at sections besides the tenors.
- Singers who are usually buried get to be audible. (I'd be willing to bet that if you don't sing bass, most of the bass parts you know are fugue entrances, and if you don't sing alto, most of the alto parts you know are from fugues that trail off at the end.)
- Parts drop out and come in.
- Parts echo each other.
- Parts sing solos or duets.
- Parts sing different words at the same time.

Think about another part you sit next to — maybe the trebles, if you're a tenor. And think about the times when you pay closest attention to them. Some probably happen in plain tunes — like "when we have a nice harmony" or "when our parts cross." But a lot are probably moments in fugues — like "when they have a fugue entrance" or "when we sing a duet together" or "when they get my favorite line in the poem before I do."

You can believe me or not about the ritual thing. But I do think it explains some things.

Almost every fuguing tune follows a different pattern of entering, repeating,
stretching, pausing, holding, and so on. (Even when two fugues are meant as
major and minor "copies" of the same idea, as sometimes happens in the Cooper
and Shenandoah books, they often have slightly different patterns.)

I think that's because, consciously or not, when someone writes a new one it's
usually with a new idea about how the class should move their attention around.
You don't just set out to write any old fugue. You think "I want a fugue where
the basses and altos get to do THIS together" or "...where everyone else stops
and listens to the trebles do THAT." And making those moments happen requires a
different pattern than other fugues followed.
