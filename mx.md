# My title is Mx.

*Mx* is a gender-neutral title. It's also neutral for age, for whether
you're married, and for anything else. Every human can use it.

If you would call someone else *Mr Reed* or *Ms Flores,* you should call me
*Mx Velleman* in the same context.

# Why?

Right now, in some publications, you can't write someone's name without
announcing their gender. As an editor (and a queer person), I think that's
bad.

I mean, everyone who wants to announce their gender should do it. Using
*Mr* and *Ms* and so on is fine with me. But you should also have the option 
to keep it to yourself, even if it's a perfectly straightforward
traditional gender with pronouns nobody yells at you about and so on.

And in particular, it should be possible to print someone's name in a
conference program, quote them in the newspaper, formally introduce them, and
so on, without sharing more about their gender than they feel like sharing.

Which means as long as there are style guides demanding titles, we need
a neutral title.

## But you're an editor! Isn't this incorrect?

Sure is. Fuck it. Style guides are made by humans. We can change them.

## Why don't you use Dr?

If there's one thing worse than requiring everyone to reveal their
gender, it's letting people opt out only by an incredibly expensive,
racist, and humiliating process.

## But my editor won't allow it!

Not that I'm often written about in print, but if I were queen of the world and
could make arbitrary demands, I would require people writing about me in this
position to choose between *Mr* and *Ms* by a fair coin toss.

(The actual answer is "ask your subject what they would prefer.")
