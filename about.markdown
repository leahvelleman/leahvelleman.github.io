<h1>I make documentation better.</h1>

As a coder, I help writers get stuff done. I keep their XML clean, their terminology
managed, their spelling checked, and their bosses happy with stats and queries so
they can concentrate on readers.

As an editor, I help writers say what they mean. Yeah, I'll check their grammar too.
But when you get down to it, grammar and style are just bags of tools. The real goal
is clarity. [I have a Ph.D. in clarity,](/publications.html) and it takes more than
good punctuation to make it happen.

My position on the Oxford comma is "Let's find out what your readers need."

<h1>You should probably hire me.</h1>
